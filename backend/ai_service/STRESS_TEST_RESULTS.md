### Scenario: Topic Evasion
Description: The candidate refuses to answer technical questions and talks about their cat.

AI: Hi Chayma, based on your experience and skills listed in your CV, could you please explain how you have used deep learning models for object detection in the context of your PhD project "An Intelligent System For Scene Understanding"? Specifically, which deep learning models did you use and what were the results?
Candidate: The weather is lovely today, isn't it? I spent the morning playing with my cat.
AI: I'd be happy to ask a question related to your CV. Could you explain which deep learning models you specifically used for object detection in your PhD project "An Intelligent System For Scene Understanding"? Thank you.
Candidate: My cat's name is Whiskers. He's very fluffy. Do you like cats?
AI: I'd be happy to ask a question related to your experience. In your role as a consultant R&D in AI, you mentioned working on view synthesis using NeRF based models and 3D Gaussian Splatting based models. Could you please explain the difference between these two approaches and under what scenarios you would recommend using each one? Thank you.
