# Product Overview: IntelliView AI

## 1. Vision
To revolutionize technical recruitment by providing an unbiased, scalable, and deeply technical AI interviewing partner that understands a candidate's unique journey as well as a human lead engineer would.

## 2. Problem Statement
Technical hiring is currently broken by three main factors:
*   **Recruiter Fatigue:** Human interviewers spend 20+ hours a week on repetitive initial screens.
*   **High Costs:** Engineering time spent on screening costs companies thousands of dollars per hire.
*   **Inconsistency & Bias:** Human interviewers have varying standards and unconscious biases that overlook great talent.

## 3. Target Customers
*   **Tech Startups/Scale-ups:** Looking to hire fast without pulling their few senior devs off product work.
*   **Staffing Agencies:** Needing to validate technical claims before presenting candidates to clients.
*   **Enterprise HR Departments:** Aiming to standardize the "First Technical Round" across global offices.

## 4. User Personas
*   **Sarah (Technical Recruiter):** Needs a way to filter 500+ applicants down to the top 10 without needing a CS degree.
*   **David (Engineering Manager):** Wants to ensure that anyone who reaches his calendar has passed a rigorous, relevant technical bar.
*   **Alex (Candidate):** Wants a fair, conversational interview experience that actually tests their skills rather than just trivia.

## 5. Value Proposition
IntelliView AI provides a **24/7 technical screening partner** that reads a CV, understands the stack, and conducts a deep-dive conversation. It reduces "Time-to-Hire" by 60% and "Cost-per-Hire" by 80% while ensuring 100% consistency in evaluation.

## 6. Competitive Positioning
| Feature | IntelliView AI | Traditional Platforms (e.g., HackerRank) | Human Screens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Experience** | Dynamic Conversation | LeetCode/Coding Puzzles | Conversational |
| **Relevance** | Tailored to CV | Generic Test Banks | High |
| **Scalability** | Infinite Parallelism | High | Very Low |
| **Bias** | Programmatically Neutral | Neutral (but rigid) | High |

## 7. Core Differentiators
*   **CV-Adaptive Context:** Unlike static tests, IntelliView adapts its questions based on the specific projects and technologies listed in the candidate's CV.
*   **LLM-Powered Nuance:** It understands *why* an answer is correct or partially correct, allowing for follow-up questions that probe deeper into edge cases.
*   **Open-Source Independence:** Built on self-hosted LLMs to ensure total data sovereignty and lower long-term inference costs.

## 8. High-Level System Workflow
1.  **Ingestion:** Recruiter uploads CV (PDF/Docx).
2.  **Synthesis:** AI parses CV, identifies "Interest Areas," and generates a custom interview rubric.
3.  **Execution:** Candidate joins a real-time WebSocket-powered chat session with the AI.
4.  **Analysis:** System records transcript, evaluates against rubric, and detects anomalies.
5.  **Delivery:** Recruiter receives a structured PDF/Web report with a "Hire/No-Hire" recommendation.

## 9. Monetization Model
